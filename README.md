By: Matthew Whitcombe\
Supervisor: Dr. Ceni Babaoglu

Raw dataset used for the project:
>Roldán, María Carina, modified by Gus Segura (2014, June). Sample Sales Data; Version 1. [Retrieved Sept 13, 2022] from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data?resource=download!



**Stages of the Project:**
1) Selecting a Theme (ex. Classification, and Regression)

3) Prepare an abstract that goes over problem I'm looking to solve, the theme(s) i've chosen to focus on, and give some information about the chosen dataset.
4) Prepare a Literatuer review: Research multiple papers, and/or books that discuss topics similar to the questions I'm going to answer.
5) Data Exploration: Scan through the data, and look for possible areas of the dataset that may need to be cleansed.
6) Approach: Discuess my step by step process on how I'm going to anaylsis my dataset I've chosen, and answer the problems I've identified in my abstract.
7) Inital Results and the Code: Execute the steps mentioned in the approach section of the project.
8) Final Results and Project Report: Compliing all the previous sections discussed, with the inclusion of a list of all the findings, detailed interpretation of the results of the applied techniques. The shortcomings of the work and concluding remarks on the continuity of the work 
9) Presentation: Present findings to two examiners
